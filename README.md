Updated with Buttons looking more soft and button-y. The value input/sliders have dark background with bright values.
Brighter UI makes the content/renderview stand out more.

Solarized (Light) theme works great when working day-time in bright studio/office environments where dark text on light background makes the user interface more read-able.
